# 📐 Wireframing

## 🧾 Introduction

**Wireframing** is the process of creating a basic visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website or application. It serves as a blueprint for the layout, structure, and functionality of the user interface, without focusing on design elements like colors, fonts, or images.

Wireframes are typically low-fidelity and help teams quickly conceptualize and iterate ideas before development begins.

## 🎯 Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process

- **Clarifies Structure**: Wireframes help visualize the layout and placement of elements, making it easier to plan the information architecture of a product.
  
- **Improves Communication**: They serve as a shared reference for designers, developers, and stakeholders, facilitating better collaboration and feedback.
  
- **Saves Time & Resources**: Identifying usability issues early reduces the cost and effort of making changes later in the development cycle.
  
- **Encourages Iteration**: Low-fidelity wireframes are easy to edit, allowing teams to experiment and refine ideas quickly.
